## BlendMode Enum

Blend modes are used to blend layers together to create an interesting effect in a layer, or even to produce what  
seems like a new layer. Unlike the method of using transparency which can result in a washed-out top layer, blend  
modes can create a variety of very vibrant and intriguing results by blending a layer with the layer(s) below it.

```csharp
public enum BlendMode
```
