Asset files, by default, will load from the `dymaptic.GeoBlazor.Core` library at `./_content/dymaptic.GeoBlazor.Core/assets`.

If for some reason you want to bundle your own assets, you would change this by adding an environment variable or setting
in `appsettings.json` of `"ArcGISAssetsPath": "...your/web/assets/url"`
